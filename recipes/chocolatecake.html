    <p class="center">Let's make a gluten free Garbanzo Bean chocolate cake!</p>

    <h2 class="center">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 (19 ounce) can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="center">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan.</li>
      <li>
        Place chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until chocolate melted and smooth, about 2 minutes,
        stirring every 20 seconds after 1 minute. If you have a powerful microwave, reduce the power to 50 percent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine garbanzo beans and eggs in the bowl of a food processor; process until smooth. Add sugar and baking
        powder; pulse to blend. Pour in melted chocolate; process until smooth, scraping corners to make sure chocolate
        is completely mixed. Transfer batter to the prepared cake pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool in the
        pan on a wire rack for 10 to 15 minutes before inverting onto a serving plate. Dust with confectioners' sugar
        just before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
