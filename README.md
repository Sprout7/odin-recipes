# odin-recipes

Build basic recipe website using HTML

Practiced html boiler plate

Worked on headers, paragraphs, anchor tags + elements, links and
imgs

Cycled through git add + git commits

Worked on adding classes to elements. Target elements to add
css such as color, background-color, width, height, font-family. Worked on "normal flow" such as block and inline.
